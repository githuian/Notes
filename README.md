# No title

Networking stack. 

Containers. I have no idea about how to use Docker or Kubernetes. (Are those related?) I have a vague idea that they let me spin up a separate VM in a predictable way. Sounds cool but I haven’t tried it.

Serverless. Also sounds cool. Never tried it. I don’t have a clear idea of how that model changes backend programming (if it does at all).

Microservices. If I understand correctly, this just means “many API endpoints talking to each other”. 

Node backends. I understand how to run Node, used some APIs like fs for build tooling, and can set up Express. But I’ve never talked from Node to a database and don’t really know how to write a backend in it. I’m also not familiar with React frameworks like Next beyond a “hello world”.

Functional languages. Unless you count JavaScript, I’m not fluent in any traditionally functional language. (I’m only fluent in C# and JavaScript — and I already forgot most of C#.) I struggle to read either LISP-inspired (like Clojure), Haskell-inspired (like Elm), or ML-inspired (like OCaml) code.

Functional terminology. Map and reduce is as far as I go. I don’t know monoids, functors, etc. I know what a monad is but maybe that’s an illusion.

Modern CSS. I don’t know Flexbox or Grid. Floats are my jam.

CSS Methodologies. I used BEM (meaning the CSS part, not the original BEM) but that’s all I know. I haven’t tried OOCSS or other methodologies.

SCSS / Sass. Never got to learn them.

CORS. I dread these errors! I know I need to set up some headers to fix them but I’ve wasted hours here in the past.

HTTPS / SSL. Never set it up. Don’t know how it works beyond the idea of private and public keys.

GraphQL. I can read a query but I don’t really know how to express stuff with nodes and edges, when to use fragments, and how pagination works there.

Sockets. My mental model is they let computers talk to each other outside the request/response model but that’s about all I know.

Streams. Aside from Rx Observables, I haven’t worked with streams closely. I used old Node streams one or two times but always messed up error handling.

Electron. Never tried it.

TypeScript. I understand the concept of types and can read annotations but I’ve never written it. The few times I tried, I ran into difficulties.

Deployment and devops. I can manage to send some files over FTP or kill some processes but that’s the limit of my devops skills.

Graphics. Whether it’s canvas, SVG, WebGL or low-level graphics, I’m not productive in it. I get the overall idea but I’d need to learn the primitives.
